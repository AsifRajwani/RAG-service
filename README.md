# RAG

ðŸ“Œ **Demo Overview**

Hands-on demo of AI orchestration with LLMs and MCP servers, fully local setup.

This repository is part of a larger demo showcasing how to combine:

- Real-time or sample data and proprietary documents (e.g., specifications, promotions, warranties).
- The vast knowledge and reasoning abilities of a Large Language Model (LLM).
- MCP Servers, which securely provide data and documents to the AI Agent.

Together, these components demonstrate how an AI Agent can orchestrate across multiple sources to generate deep insights â€” for example, identifying new product bundles or designing targeted promotions.

ðŸ‘‰ This repo is one of several components that make up the full demo.

ðŸ‘‰ The [PDF Guide](https://github.com/AsifRajwani/MCP-Server/blob/main/AI%20Agent%20MCP%20Demo.pdf) details all the setup required to run all components locally on your personal computer.

```

**Search for word example and return top 3 results.**

```bash
    url "http://localhost:4100/search?query=example&k=3"
```

**Search for the 'UltraBook Pro 15 warranty" and return top 3 results.**

```bash.
    curl "http://localhost:4100/search?query=UltraBook%20Pro%2015%20warranty&k=3"
```
